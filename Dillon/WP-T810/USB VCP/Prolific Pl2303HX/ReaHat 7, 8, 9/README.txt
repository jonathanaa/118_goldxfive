PL-2303 (Chip H/HX/X) Linux driver for RedHat 7.3/8.0/9.0 Only.
NOTE: No need to install drivers for following:
Linux Kernel 2.4.31 and above already includes built-in drivers for PL-2303H, PL-2303XA/HXA and PL-2303HXD.
NOTE: Google Android OS is also based on Linux kernel so it also supports PL2303.
